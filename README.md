# Magic8Ball
Just simple app with a ball, that is used for fortune-telling or seeking advice. It was invented in 1946 by Albert C. Carter and Abe Bookman and is currently manufactured by Mattel. The user asks a yesâ€“no question to the ball, then turns it over to reveal an answer in a window on the ball.
